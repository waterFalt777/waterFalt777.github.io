My goals are to grow my analytical skills, confidence, and creativity in applying them. With all my group project based experiences, I like working with teams uncovering a human focus insights from data and coming up with efficient and productive ways to bring out the best of every team member. I look forward to finding my place in the tech industry where I can enjoy working in a a and creative environment that promotes inclusivity and inspires hard-earned success. A creative side to me, is that Iâ€™m an amateur 3d modeler/animator specializing in using Blender (an open-source 3D computer graphics software). On the side, I like to make models of characters, objects, small scenes for personal or videogame projects.
